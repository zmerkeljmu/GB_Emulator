# Game Boy Emulator

**From-scratch Game Boy emulator in C++ featuring debugger tools and support for running select original ROMs such as Tetris.**  
**Status:** _Archived — no longer under active development._

---

## Overview

This project replicates core components of the original Nintendo Game Boy, including the CPU, memory, and graphics pipeline. It was developed as a learning exercise in low-level programming, hardware emulation, and systems development.  

While not intended as a production-quality emulator, it runs several commercial ROMs and includes a suite of debugging tools designed to make the inner workings of the Game Boy easier to explore and understand.

## Tests

The emulator was validated against community-created test ROMs:  

- **Blargg Test ROMs**: [https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms)  
- **Mooneye Test Suite**: [https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-test-suite](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-test-suite)  
- **CPU Instruction JSON Tests**: [https://github.com/SingleStepTests/sm83](https://github.com/SingleStepTests/sm83)

## External Libraries Used

- **Dear ImGui**: [https://github.com/ocornut/imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)  
- **tinyfiledialogs**: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/)  
- **OpenGL** – graphics rendering  
- **SDL2** – window management and input

## Known Limitations

- Timer implementation is not cycle-accurate.  
- Only supports ROMs without a Memory Bank Controller (MBC).  
- Audio is not implemented.  
- Certain timing and PPU edge cases remain inaccurate.
