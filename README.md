# Game Boy Emulator

**From-scratch Game Boy emulator in C++ featuring debugger tools and support for running select original ROMs such as Tetris.**  
**Status:** _Archived ‚Äî no longer under active development._

---

## Overview

This project replicates core components of the original Nintendo Game Boy, including the CPU, memory, and graphics pipeline. It was developed as a learning exercise in low-level programming, hardware emulation, and systems development.  

While not intended as a production-quality emulator, it runs several commercial ROMs and includes a suite of debugging tools designed to make the inner workings of the Game Boy easier to explore and understand.

## Known Limitations

- Timer implementation is not cycle-accurate.  
- Only supports ROMs without a Memory Bank Controller (MBC).  
- Audio is not implemented.  
- Certain timing and PPU edge cases remain inaccurate.
